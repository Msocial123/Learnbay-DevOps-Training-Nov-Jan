	1. Clean code
	2. Secure code
	3. Maintainable code
	4. Compliance with coding standards 

Why ?
=====

	Ø To detect bugs early
	Ø  improve security 
	Ø Enforces coding standards 
	Ø Integrate with cicd
	Ø Work with all major lngs


Key concepts of Sonarqube
=======================

	1. Code smell:- non-breaking issues but reduce maintainability , ex:- long method, duplicate codes, unused variables
	2. Bugs:- issues that may cause functional failures
	3. Vulnerability:-  security issues that attackers can exploit , ex:- weak hashing , insecure connections
	4. HotSpots:- security-sensitive code that needs manual review
	5. Quality Gate:- a set of rules that decide code is good or not


How Sonarqube works internally 
===========================

	1. Code is analyzed:- using sonar scanner or ci pipeline plugin 
	2. Result are sent to sonarqube server
	3. Dashboard visualize issues
	4. Developers fix code


Maven
======

Pom:- project object model

	Maven builds files called 👇
	
	1. War file:- web archive :- for maven based app's
	2. Jar file:- java archive:- for java based app's
	3. Ear file:- enterprise archive:- for enterprise level app's


Maven commands
===============

	1. Mvn --version
	2. Mvn clean:- it will delete target folder , removes all compiled files, jar, war and ensures a fresh build
	3. Mvn compile:- it will compile the src inside src/main/java
	4. Mvn test :- runs tests inside src/test/java
	5. Mvn package :- it will pkg the compiling code into jar file, war file and ear file
	6. Mvn deploy :- it will deploy ur war or jar into nexus server , nexus will convert ur war, jar into artifacts, snapshots (developer copy) and release
