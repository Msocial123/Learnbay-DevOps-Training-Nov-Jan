Docker Volumes
=============

	Ø Docker volume is nothing but it’s a directory 
	Ø You are going to declaring a volume as a directory 
	Ø Volume is a directory inside a container
	Ø First declare a directory as a volume
	Ø Volume will be created in one container
	Ø It is better or good approach to create a volume along with ur container
	Ø Once container got created its difficult to attach the volume to the container
	Ø You can share one volume with n.no of containers
	Ø Volume will not be included when you are going to update ur docker image 
	Ø Becz volume is going to creating out side of the file system 


Types of volumes
==============

	1. Anonymous volumes:- there is no meaningful name to the volumes :- /var/lib/docker/volumes
	2. Named volume:- we  are going to assigning a meaningful name to the volume:- /var/lib/docker/volumes
	3. Bind volume:- you are going to choosing location where you want to create volume 

How to share one volume with another container 
========================================

docker run -it --name c4 --privileged=true  --volumes-from c3 ubuntu /bin/bash

--privileged=true :- 


Network in Docker
==============

	Ø Network is 3 types

	1. Bridge network:- it is for prod use, it is a default primary network in docker and it will give one ip add to the container , containers communicate using container names
	2. Host :- it wont give any ip add for the containers uses hosts network directly , no port mapping required and less secure 
	3. None:- no networking at all

	Ø DOCKER ONLY CREATES CONTIANERS NOT MANAGING 
	Ø Containers are very light weight 
	Ø Docker will not support self-healing or auto-healing
	Ø Docker will not handle LB
Docker will not support AS
