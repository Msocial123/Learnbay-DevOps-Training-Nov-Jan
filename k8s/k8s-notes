Wt is k8s?
========

	Ø It is a containerization management tool:- it k8s never create any container and it will manage only the container
	Ø Also it’s a orchestration tool:- k8s has many resources or objects:- it requires one manager is called orchestration 
	Ø It is an open source platform:- its completely free any one can use


History of k8s
===========

	Ø K8s was created by google in 2013 in Go lng
	Ø Initially k8s was not open source platform
	Ø But in 2014 google has donated k8s to CNCF(cloud native computing foundation) and its continued as an open source platform.

K8s:- is called cluster
Cluster:- is combination of nodes
Node:- is called vm

Pod:- it is a smallest deployable unit it is nothing but where we are going to managing our container is called pod

Features of k8s
=============

	1. Autoscaling:- k8s automatically scale up and scale down app resources as per the app demand:- Vertical AS:- It will crease cpu's, memory and storage, Horizontal AS:- It will increase servers.
	2. Auto healing :- 10 pods :- 2 pods got deleted :- app down time:- k8s automatically will repair ur pods or will create new pods within fraction of ms for not getting any app down time.
	3. Load balancing:- it is responsibility to distribute the users traffic between  the servers equally and k8s can manage load balancing of app very well.
	4. Platform independent:- k8s can work on any infra or any cloud  or on-premises
	5. Fault tolerance:- k8s will notify you if any node or pod fails
	6. Rollback :- you can switch to previous version ,  3.1.2  --> 3.1.3
	7. Health monitoring of containers:- k8s regularly will monitor containers health
	8. Orchestration:- it will act as manager in k8s cluster to managing entire k8s resources or objects.


Cluster
======

	Ø combination of nodes
	Ø Node is nothing but vm
	Ø Every cluster has two type nodes


	1. Master node / control plane
	2. Worker node


	1. Master node
  ==============


	Ø It is going to managing entire ur cluster and its actual state
	Ø Master node is heart of the cluster
	Ø Master node is responsible to make available workers node ( without master node u cant get any worker node)
	Ø Usually every cluster has one master and has multiple worker nodes
	Ø Master node has 4 components


	1. API server
  ===========

	Ø it is an entry point of cluster .
	Ø Whenever you run the command first request will go to the api server only
	Ø It will validate requests and updates cluster state .
	Ø All communication between components goes through api server

	2. Etcd
  =======

	Ø The entire cluster info or data is going to be stored in a etcd
	Ø It is nothing but like database for cluster
	Ø It will store ur data in the form  key-value-pair


	3. Controller manager
  ===================

	Ø It is called as kube-controller-manager
	Ø It will ensure ur cluster is always in desired state, 0 dp > 2 dp, 10 pods , 0 pods > 10 pods
	Ø Node controller, replication controller, job controller, endpoints controller 
	Ø Before creating any resource in cluster ur cluster will be in actual state from actual state to desired state , I hv desirted to create 5 pods , 5 dp .

	4. Scheduler 
  ===========

	Ø 5 wn  >  50 pods  >  10 pods > 10*5=50
	Ø It will schedule ur cluster tasks
	Ø It will decide which node a pod should run on

Worker node
===========

	Ø With the help of master node only we can create n.of wn 
	Ø Where ur app workload is going to be deployed is called wn
	Ø It will communicate with the master node
	Ø Where the actual app's run 
	Ø Wn also has 4 components 

	1. Kubelet
  =========

	Ø It is an agent on every worker node
	Ø It will communicate with api server
	Ø It will create n manage ur pods in wn

	2. Kube-proxy
  ============

	Ø It will contain entire cluster network info like node ip, pod ip , svc ip
	Ø It will implement k8s svc concept
	Ø It will maintain ip tables
	Ø It will make communicate pod to svc

3.pod 
=====

	Ø it is a smallest deployable unit it is nothing but where we are going to managing our container is called pod

	4. Container runtime
  ==================

	Ø It will run container in k8s 
	Ø K8s doesn't run container 


Kubectl:- it is a command line interface tool how we are going to communicate with the cluster

Kubectl as 


How to create ns
==============

	Ø In a cluster whenever u want to create any resource u have follow two approaches 

	1. Imperative style:- using commands is called imperative style
	2. Declarative style:- using yaml 


Prerequisites of eks cluster in aws
============================

	1. You need a vm
	2. Iam user and generate aws access keys
	3. Install kubectl on vm: it is cli 
	4. Install eksctl on vm:- to creating cluster via cli
	5. Install aws cli on vm
	6. Configure aws access keys on vm
	7. Create a cluster using cli

eksctl create cluster --name murali-cluster --region sa-east-1  --zones sa-east-1a,sa-east-1b  --nodegroup-name k8s-ng  --node-type t2.small  --nodes 2
